# Twine SugarCube Macros & Other Things, by SleepyFool
A soon-to-be-filled library of macros of dubious value

&nbsp;

### Macros:

  - [divider](./divider-macro) - creates a divider while hiding old dividers created this way
  - [p](./p-macro) - automatically wrap enclosed chunks of text into `<p>` elements
  - [select](./select-macro) - creates a link which removes all other links in its group when clicked

### Other Things:

  - [Twine desktop app themes](./Twine-themes) - `user.css` customization options for <b>Twine desktop 2.7</b>
  - [CSS pack](./css-pack) - a `CSS` pack created to imitate Harlowe's quick `(text-style:)`, should work for any `HTML`
